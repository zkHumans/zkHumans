- Follow
  [`commitizen's conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
  commit message format
- Use `npm run commit` or `npx cz` for a prompt to assist writing the commit
  message properly
- The conventional commit scope (the type of change) typically corresponds to Nx
  project; ie "contracts" or "api"
  - when possible, keep git commits project- and context- specific (ok to
    deviate for some broad refactors/migrations)
  - refer to `git log <filename>` for current conventions
