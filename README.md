# zkHumans

A protocol and platform for Zero-Knowledge Self-Sovereign Crypto-Biometric
Decentralized Identity, Collective Association, and Access Control.

## How it Works

- A zkHumans Identity consists of:
  - one or more Authentication Factors within a Merkle Map
  - a static unique identifier (UUID) and a Merkle Map commitment (its current
    root hash representing the Authentication Factors within it) .
- Each Identity's `identifier:commitment` is added as key:value data to a
  Identity Manager's MerkleMap
  - A Manager also has a static identifier (zkApp address) and root commitment
- A SmartContract manages authenticated state transformations of the Manager
  Merkle Tree including:
  - addition of new Identities
  - addition/removal of Authentication Factors from Identities
  - authentication of Identity ownership by other composing SmartContracts
- Proving ownership of an Identity consists of proving:
  - 1. An Authentication Factor (as key:value data) is within the Identity's
       MerkleMap
  - 2. The Identity's `key:value` is within the Manager's MerkleMap
  - depending on the authenticating context, one or more Authentication Factors
    of specific types may be required to prove ownership
- Off-chain Merkle data is stored within a database powered by ZK:KV; zkHumans'
  purpose-built, but generally useful, ZK-data storage solution with the
  following features:
  - data is public but secret, only the owner of an Identity may access the
    secrets of their data (ZK!), otherwise it is random numbers to others
  - optional storage meta data is public and facilitates protocol and/or
    connectivity to other database references
  - facilitates decentralized and distributed node data
  - database agnostic; the reference implementation uses Prisma for
    high-availability, scalability, and local performance of SQL (using
    Postgres, for example)
  - many and multiple nodes may independently verify and distribute storage data
  - all writes to storage are manged by the contract and updated locally by an
    indexer service, other services have read-only data access
  - transaction concurrency; multiple concurrent writes to storage are
    facilitated by first recording stroage state transformations as pending then
    comitting pending storage with a prover process
  - the pattern of MerkleMap identifier:commitment as key:value data within
    another MerkleMap is recursive thus enabling very large amounts of verified
    storage with minimal state information

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/)

- Follow
  [`commitizen's conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
  commit message format
- Use `npm run commit` or `npx cz` for a prompt to assist writing the commit
  message properly
- The conventional commit scope (the type of change) typically corresponds to Nx
  project; ie "contracts" or "api"
  - when possible, keep git commits project- and context- specific (ok to
    deviate for some broad refactors/migrations)
  - refer to `git log <filename>` for current conventions
